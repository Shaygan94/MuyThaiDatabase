ThaiBoxingDatabase
A Java project inspired by the 2025 Java exam, designed to manage Muay Thai data ‚Äî countries, cities, clubs, and fighters ‚Äî with a combination of file-based data handling and MySQL database integration.

üìÑ About
The application reads and writes data related to Thai boxing: countries, cities, Muay Thai clubs, and fighters. It supports adding new entries interactively via an Admin Menu that updates existing text files or creates new ones as needed to persist the data.

The backend uses JDBC to connect to a MySQL database, leveraging a structured relational schema with proper keys and constraints. The project is built with Maven for dependency management and uses the MySQL Connector/J version 8.0.30 for database connectivity.

üí° Key Features
Interactive Admin Menu for adding countries, cities, clubs, and fighters.

Automatic update and creation of structured text files to reflect changes in the data.

Reads data from text files and imports into a MySQL database via JDBC.

Well-defined database schema with primary keys, foreign keys, and relational integrity.

Clean Maven project structure, easy to build and extend.

Uses MySQL Connector/J 8.0.30 to ensure compatibility with MySQL Workbench and the database.
